## Using Vagrant

All the following commands must be run from the project root directory.

### To start the development environment

vagrant up
```

```
vagrant halt
```

### To remove the development environment

Use with caution this will delete all the files in your development environment.

## Rebuilding the development environment

### Updating the project

To get all the latest improvements you'll want to update from time to time; to
update the project directory run the following command from the project root
directory:

```bash
git pull
```

### Destroying the development environment

Before you can rebuild your development environment you have to destroy your
current one; make sure all your files your important files have been backed up
to the persistent disk before rebuilding your virtual machine; you can find the
persistent copies of your files under `/var/persistent/home/dev`.

When you're ready to destroy the development environment, run the following
command from the project root directory:

```bash
vagrant destroy
```

### Recreating the development environment

This is the same as provisioning for the first time.

Run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
