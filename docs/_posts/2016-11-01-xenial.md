Since Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) is out of support this project has moved to
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus).

You can find out the highlights of the Ubuntu 16.04 by reviewing the
[release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes).

The biggest change to be aware of is Ubuntu 16.04 has moved to Python 3; if your
using this project for Python development or just using Python scripts/apps
you may encounter breaking changes. You can review the Python 3 changes in the
[what's new](https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html) documentation.
