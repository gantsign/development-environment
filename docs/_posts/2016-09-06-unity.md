To make the development environment as robust as possible, the
[Ubuntu Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(Ubuntu)) desktop is now
installed by default. As Unity is the default desktop on Ubuntu it tends to have
better support from third party apps.

For those of you who prefer the previous [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org) desktop,
it's still available and can be selected through
[configuration]({{ '/docs/configuration' | relative_url }}).
