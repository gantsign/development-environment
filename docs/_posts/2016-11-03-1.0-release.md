{% include base_path %}

After more than seven months of development, GantSign EnV has matured enough for
its first production quality release.

From this point it's recommended users GantSign EnV use tagged releases of this
project rather than following development on the master branch.

New users can follow the
[getting started guide]({{ base_path }}/docs/getting-started) to use this
release.

Existing users can run the following command to switch to the new version.

```
git fetch && git checkout 1.0.0
```

You can always find the latest version and review the release notes on the
[releases]({{ site.release.list_url }}) page.
