Since GitKraken is no longer free for
commercial use](https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing)
it's been replaced in the GantSign development environment.

Installed in place of GitKraken are Git-GUI and Gitk; while they're a lot less
pretty, they are more stable, feature complete and are open source.

For more details of Git-GUI and Gitk support view the
[features]({{ '/docs/features/#gitk' | relative_url }}) page.
