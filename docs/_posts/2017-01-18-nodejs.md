While Node.js has been bundled with this development environment for the last
few months, it hasn't been a document feature.

After successfully using the Node.js support on a couple of projects it's time
to promote it as a documented feature.

For details of the Node.js support view the
[features]({{ '/docs/features/#for-nodejs-developers' | relative_url }})
page.
