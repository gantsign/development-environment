## About

Getting your development environment setup correctly can be a time consuming and
error prone process; getting everyone on a team to setup their environment
correctly is even more challenging.

The goal of this project is to make setting up a development environment
reliable and reproducible. This project provides a generic development
environment that you can fork to add your project specific configuration.
